# LEDsimonsays

Project created in an electrical engineering lab course. Designed by myself and a peer student, Aaron Fennemas. 

Project status: complete

Description: This project uses a microcontroller programmed to generate a random number sequence which corresponds to the connected LEDs 
as shown in the specification sheet. The program briefly turns on the LEDs and the user is meant to match the order with the correct 
button press. The initial sequence is increased as the user succeeds, up to 10 rounds. An LCD screen is also included to communicate with 
the player.
